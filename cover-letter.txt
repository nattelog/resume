I'm Natanael, a 24 year old engineering student currently in my fourth year of
studies. I'm expecting to be finished summer 2018. I have 6 years of summer work
experience at Ericsson and Tieto. Most recently, at Tieto, I developed a web
platform to monitor data sent through the cloud. I also initiated automated
testing on the platform as well as on the back end API. During fall 2016 I
worked 20 % extra on top of studies. I have 5 years of summer work experience at
Ericsson in Kumla. I've worked there as an SMT operator and a production
planner.

About myself: married to Sara, great at drums and guitar and love cooking. I'm a
great teamplayer and most of all a fast learner. Although my freshest software
experience is of web I have studied both low and high level programming and have
good knowledge in most of the classic languages such as C, C++, Java and
Javascript.

I hope you find my profile interesting and I would love to hear more from
you. Please read my resume for more detail of my skills, education and
experience.
